\subsection{Equations of Motion for Rigid Airframe}

As shown in \cite{Cooke}...

The axes to be used are the helicopter body axes $(O,x,y,z)$ fixed in the helicopter and with its origin at the body axes centre. The components of velocity and force along the $Ox$, $Oy$ and $Oz$ axes are $U$, $V$, $W$ and $X$, $Y$, $Z$, respectively. The components of the rates of rotation about the same axes are $p$, $q$ and $r$ and the moments $L$, $M$ and $N$.

Considering the position that the position of the centre of gravity $CG$ is given by the co-ordinates $d_x$, $d_y$ and $d_z$ relative to the body axes centre, the absolute velocity of $CG$ is given by $u'$, $v'$ and $w'$:

\begin{equation}
	u' = U - r d_y + q d_z \qquad v' = V - p d_z + r d_x \qquad w' = W - q d_x + p d_y
\end{equation}

\noindent
and similarly, for the accelerations of the $CG$:

\begin{equation}
	a'_x = \dot{U}' - r v' + q w' \qquad a'_y = \dot{v}' - p w' + r u' \qquad a_z' = \dot{w}' - q u' + p v'
\end{equation}
